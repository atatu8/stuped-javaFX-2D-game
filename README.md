# stuped-javaFX-2D-game

Uses perlin noise for simple generation and A* alghorithm for path finding. You have map 100x100 and mini map for navigation.
I had problems with real visible map size, because if you alloc block 100x100, you can get access only to block 99x99.
So if we need imaginary 100x100, we should alloc 101x101. I have all this troubles because of _example_ stump mechanic, to achieve smooth movement. You can modify game world by adding your textures in map or deleting/creating mobs. Don't use
all mechanic in this project in your real projects, because my project have many troubles. This is simple example of 2d game in javaFX.
